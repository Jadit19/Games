# Rock Paper Scissors

## Introduction
This game also needs no introduction XD. If you don't know the rules of this game, well you gotta redo second grade..<br />
A more advanced form of the game, i.e. the one played by Sheldon Cooper is also in the works and hopefully will be completed soon.

## Instructions
- In order to start the game, you need to have python3 installed on your system.
- Additionally, few libraries need to be installed. In order to do this, run the following commands in the terminal:
```sh
pip3 install opencv mediapipe
```
- Next up, open a terminal in this directory and execute the following command:
```sh
python3 game.py
```
- You can also try tweaking the variables in the `config.py` file :)
- Oh! and also, you gotta open the camera on your device, to see what you chose.
